        Nevertheless, here are a few notes you might find helpful.

    <h2>Running the game</h2>
    <dl class="faq">
        <dt>I don't see the download button, how am I supposed to play?</dt>
        <dd>
            The game runs entirely in the browser, you need not download any executable files. This allows us to support virtually every platform we are interested in and
            update the game without you even noticing an update is going on.
        </dd>
        <dt>What do I need to play? Any hardware / software requirements?</dt>
        <dd>
            We haven't gathered enough test data to provide you with precise system requirements but you should be fine with every machine running a
            moderately powerful CPU / GPU.
            We have software requirements though. You need to make sure that you have your latest video card drivers installed.
            Also, we currently only support Internet Explorer 11, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox (make sure they're updated!). We make no plans for supporting neither Opera nor Safari at the moment.
        </dd>
        <dt>How do I play?</dt>
        <dd>
            Well, you click on the "Play" button on the home page. I assume you are too lazy to go back there, so here's a <a href="http://game.thralldom.net">direct link</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>Chuck Norris can count to forever twice while waiting for the game to load. Do something ffs!</dt>
        <dd>
            We have a large amount of assets you need to download (models, textures, etc.). They take some time to download
            (as they would've taken with any other desktop game) but worry not - we're caching all those files so the next you start the game, you can even run it
            without internet access!
        </dd>
        <dt>Do I need internet access to play?</dt>
        <dd>
            Only the first time the game is loaded (and whenever you'd like to update). Take a look at the previous question.
        </dd>

    <h2>Playing</h2>
    <dl class="faq">
        <dt>What do I do after I begin the game?</dt>
        <dd>
            Follow the mission objectives in the top left angle of the screen.
        </dd>
        <dt>How do I move?</dt>
        <dd>
            We are using standard action game keybindings. Use WASD to move, Space to jump and your LMB (Left Mouse Button) to attack (if you have a weapon equipped).
        </dd>
        <dt>I finished my mission, now what?</dt>
        <dd>
            Currently, we only have a single playable mission so after you finish it, there's not much to do but to wait until our next release.
            We also would really appreaciate if you <a href="index.html/#contact">contact us</a> for feedback.
