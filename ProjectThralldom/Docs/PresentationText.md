## Intro
Good afternoon. I'd like to start this talk with a question.
How many of you have played a video game in the past 2 weeks? Please raise your hands.  
Thank you, that's plenty, it's basically everyone.
Nice to see likeminded people in the room.

Our team here is madly inlove with video games. We enjoy all kinds of games, be it:
- games that make you think by solving puzzles
- games that let you save the world from a zombie outbreak
- games that let you play as goat and destroy everything in your path
- ... even games that have you play as the president of the USA, walking around with a giant pink... bat

(ok, perhaps we spend too much time gaming)  
but of all the options, we enjoy games that tell a deep, meaningful story the most.

They give the player a broad range of emotions and experiences. Conceptually, they aren't much different from a good book or a movie
... so we decided to build one

As a little late introduction, my name's Nikola, a programmer at heart,
to my right is Filip, a nerd at heart which explains why he is our game designer,
to my left is Borislav, he likes to draw stuff, mostly butts ![butts][butts]

The game we spent our last month on is called `Thralldom`. I'll try to explain in 3 simple lines. `Thralldom` is:
- a 3d game
- runs entirely in the browser
- tells the story of 'Under the Yoke' by the famous Ivan Vazov
![under][yoke]


Since a picture is worth a thousand words, instead of telling you about the game,
we'll invite you to play. 

## Demo
Those of you with updated browsers and video card drivers are welcome to enter http://thralldom.net and click on the 'Play' button to see our work. 

Filip here has started a new game, skipped the prologue and is now playing our first mission.
For those of you that don't remember, the story starts with main protagonist, Ivan Kralich, a revolutioner who recently escaped the
heavyly guarded turkish prison of Diarbekir and has just set foot in the small town of Biala Cherkva, seeking aid from a close friend
of his father. He wanders the streets, trying to remain unseen by the town's police while searching for Bai Marko's house.
He encounters a man (lately revealed to be Dr. Sokolov) who gives him directions. Ivan finds the house and gets to talk with Marko when 
suddenly... well, to find out what happens next, you'll need to either play the game or (re) read the book.

## Will it sell?
Let's talk about the bussiness side of things.
We thought the idea sounds awesome and *if done correctly* the game can be a big hit. 
To assure ourselves this is the case, we made some research. I keep close contacts with a few a my teachers in High / Middle school 
so I asked them to have their students fill a small form I made. Some of my colleagues / students in the University of Sofia filled the form as well and here are the results:

Would you play a game based on 'Under the yoke'?

Gamer percentage:
**gamers**

The first diagram shows that people are eager to play (or at the very least try) our game. The second proves that even people who aren't considered as gamers are interested in it.

What's even more interesting is that it seems we weren't the only with this type of idea. Here are some screenshots from a popular forum. The topic was "What kind of a game would you create?" (sorry non-Bulgarian speakers)
**Insert results here**

*Bonus chart*
Here's a bonus chart that depicts that not only we'll provide our users with something they find interesting and fun, we'll promote this classic book pretty well!
Would you (re)read the book if you enjoy the game?
**read**
According to our data, 58% of the enquired have not read the book. Out of those, 73% are willing to read to book if they enjoy the game!

## How and whom will we sell it to?
If everything goes okay, we plan on releasing the game in the fall of 2014 with at least the first part of book (chapters 1 to 35) playable as various missions (not including additional side quests that delve into the time period WITHOUT breaking immersion). We'll go old school - keep the first few mission (say 5 out of 15) free so that players can see if the game suits their needs. The rest of the missions will require a small fee (10&#8364; or so). We promise to charge players for content, not upgrades.
