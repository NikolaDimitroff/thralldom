## Intro
Good afternoon. I'd like to start this talk with a question.
How many of you have played a video game in past 2 weeks? Please raise your hands.  
Plenty, it's basically everyone.


Our team here is madly inlove with video games. We enjoy all kinds of games, be it:
- games that make you solve puzzles
- games that let you kill zombies
- games that let you play as goat 
- ... even games that let you play as the president of the USA while walking around with a giant pink dildo

but of all the options, we prefer games that tell a story the most.

They give the player a broad range of emotions / experience, 
combine the best of all the other genres and are the most difficult to produce one.
... so we decided to build one

As a late introduction, my name's Nikola, a programmer at heart,
to my right is Filip, a nerd at heart which explains why he is our game designer,
to my left is Borislav, he likes to draw stuff, mostly butts ![butts][butts]

## Demo
Our game is called Thralldom and it is build around the story of 'Under the yoke' by Ivan Vazov. ![under][yoke]
It's 3d and it also runs in the browser. Actually, you can go http://thralldom.net immediately and click 
on the giant 'Play' button to see our work.

We'll do a little demo now, we've started a new game, skipped the prologue and now playing our first mission.
For those of you that don't remember, the story starts with main protagonist, Ivan Kralich, a revolutioner who recently escaped the
heavyly guarded turkish prison of Diarbekir and has just set foot in the small town of Biala Cherkva, seeking aid from a close friend
of his father. He wanders the streets, trying to remain unseen by the town's police while searching for Bai Marko's house.
He encounters a man (lately revealed to be Dr. Sokolov) who gives him directions. Ivan finds the house and gets to talk with Marko when 
suddenly... well, to find out what happens next, you'll need to either play the game or (re) read the book.

## Will it sell?
We thought the idea sounds awesome and *if done correctly* the game can be a big hit. 
To prove our point, we made some research. I keep close contacts with a few a my teachers in High / Middle school 
so I asked them to share a small form I made with their students. I also had a few my colleagues / students 
in the University of Sofia fill the form and here are the results:

**Insert results here**

## How and whom will we sell it to?
